Hello hello!

This is my first ever website project with React, so the code might be a bit funky (but I'm still learning).

For routing, im using React Routing, and for CSS im using tailwind. Otherwise the project is mainly only React.

The website contains some info about me, and has my contact info. Also I am trying to include some code snippets in it, so people can check out my work.

PSA the page is mostly in finnish. Sorry :(
